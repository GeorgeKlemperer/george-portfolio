## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility

This screenshot demonstrates some of the incorporated semantic elements in my project HTML. The HTML is designed so that it can be tabbed through by the user, and is entirely accessable via a screen reader. Alt-tags are also included on all the images and a high contrast aesthetic was used.

## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers

This was acheived by using the correct semantic elements as mentioned above: heading tabs in the correct order, &lt;li&gt; tags for navigation menu elements etc.

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

Website accessibility was checked using Google Lighthouse and scored a value of 92%. The only complaint was that one form element did not have an associated label, which turned out to be incorrect on a manual check.

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
