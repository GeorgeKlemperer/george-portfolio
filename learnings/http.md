# httpProject: The Orbituaries
A project built for practicing interacting with public APIs. Enter a date and a news category on the website to generate an image of NASA's astrology picture of the day (APOD) for that day overlayed with the Guardian's main headline for that day and news genre. The APIs utlized in the website are NASA's apod API, The Guardian API, and Unsplash.

All Founders and Coders projects are collaborative between two people. My partner for this project was Isobel Butler.

## 1. Write code that executes asynchronously

One example of asynchronous code used in the website where we fetch the APOD HD url from NASA's APOD API. Fetch is used to generate a promise and .then() and .catch() methods are used to schedule callback functions. Similar asynchronous code was used to fetch from the Guardian's and Unsplash's APIs. 

## 8. Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors
A vareity of DOM nodes were accessed using a variety of selectors. In the above code the APOD is inserted as the background imgae for an element. In the below code a different element has a Guardian headline and URL link inserted into it.

## 11. Display a loading indicator during an API fetch

A loading gif is displayed while the submitted queries are fetched.
