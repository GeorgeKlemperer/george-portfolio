# httpProject: The Orbituaries
A project built for practicing interacting with public APIs. Enter a date and a news category on the website to generate an image of NASA's astrology picture of the day (APOD) for that day overlayed with the Guardian's main headline for that day and news genre. The APIs utlized in the website are NASA's apod API, The Guardian API, and Unsplash.

All Founders and Coders projects are collaborative between two people. My partner for this project was Isobel Butler.

## 1. Write code that executes asynchronously

One example of asynchronous code used in the website where we fetch the APOD HD url from NASA's APOD API.

## 2. Use callbacks to access values that aren’t available synchronously

## 3. Use promises to access values that aren’t available synchronously

## 4. Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses

## 5. Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests

## 6. Use the map array method to create a new array containing new values

## 7. Use the filter array method to create a new array with certain values removed

## 8. Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors

## 9. Add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page

## 10. Toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties

## 11. Use consistent layout and spacing

## ?. Mobile-first design

## 12. Follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel

## 13. Debug client side JS in our web browser

## 14. Use console.log() to help us debug our code
